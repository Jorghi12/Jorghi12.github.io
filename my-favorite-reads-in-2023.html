            <p>In the course of this year, I immersed myself in a selection of intellectually enriching literature, delving into works such as "Competing Against Luck" authored by Clayton Christensen and "Zero to One" by Peter Thiel. Simultaneously, I dedicated substantial time to honing my technical proficiency through the rigorous exploration of texts such as "Real Analysis" by Rudin and "Professional CUDA C Programming" by John Cheng, Max Grossman, and Ty McKercher. The intention behind this concerted effort is to synthesize a comprehensive understanding of these subjects, culminating in the eventual sharing of meticulously crafted notes on my revamped personal websiteâ€”an endeavor long overdue for an update.</p>

            <p>Moreover, it is worth noting that each of the aforementioned books has been meticulously studied, with my engagement extending beyond mere perusal. I have revisited them on numerous occasions, having read each tome no less than 50 times. This repetitive immersion has been complemented by an extensive note-taking process, resulting in the compilation of hundreds of pages of insights. Furthermore, I undertook a synoptic examination, exploring tangentially related works to broaden the scope of my knowledge and intellectual pursuits.</p>
