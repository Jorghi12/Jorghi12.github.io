            <p>Over the last year, I’ve voraciously read through hundreds of books touching a vast number of subjects. Here I'll share a few of my favorites.</p>

            <p><b>Ben Horowitz: The Hard Thing about Hard Things</b> — If you want to hear about the harsh realities of starting a company, then Ben Horowitz is your man. He talks about hiring correctly at different stages of your company, firing personal, etc. He starts each chapter with old school rap lyrics, which is another great reason to read it.</p>
            <p><b>Brad Stone: The Everything Store</b> — The book is very well written and does an amazing job describing the uniqueness of both Jeff Bezos and Amazon.</p>
            <p><b>Ray Dalio: Principles</b> — In the book, Principles, Ray Dalio does a great job convincing you why having well thought out Principles is important for living a great life. “Ray Dalio has provided me with invaluable guidance and insights that are now available to you in Principles.” — Bill Gates.</p>
            <p><b>Reid Hoffman: The Startup Of You</b> — Generally when people hear the word start up, they imagine an innovative company. In The Startup of You, Reid Hoffman reminds you of the most important start up, YOU, and how to build your career. “Everyone, women and men alike, needs to think big to succeed. This is a practical book that shows you how to take control and build a career that will enable you to have real impact.” -Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook.</p>
            <p><b>Nassim Nicholas Taleb: The Black Swan</b> — Nassim Taleb coins the term “Black Swan”. A Black Swan event is a nearly impossible to predict event (an outlier) with extreme ramifications, generally explained via hindsight bias in order to make it appear predictable, a la the narrative fallacy. “The Black Swan changed my view of how the world works.” — Daniel Kahneman, Nobel laureate.</p>
            <p><b>Daniel Susskind and Richard Susskind</b> — The Future of Professions — In the Future of Professions, Daniel and Richard believe that a radical shift in our society is coming and we must prepare ourselves. They give an overview of prior technological advancements and attempt to make predictions on the future.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading" style='color:black;text-align:center'>In Summary</h2>
            <p>These are the books that I've read most recently that I found to expand one's style of thought. I encourage you to share your favorite list as well. Always looking for fascinating reads.</p>
